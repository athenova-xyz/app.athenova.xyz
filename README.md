✨ The Vision
Athenova is a DeFi-native launchpad for educational courses, built to break down the barriers between creators, their communities, and the value they generate together. We're replacing traditional gatekeepers with a transparent, community-driven ecosystem where:
Educators can fund their ambitious projects without seeking venture capital.
Backers become co-owners, sharing in the financial success of courses they believe in.
Learners access high-quality content through a seamless, Web3-native experience.
This is more than just a course platform; it's a new economy for knowledge.
🚀 Core Features
🗣️ Decentralized Crowdfunding: Creators launch campaigns to raise funds in crypto directly from their community. No middlemen, no opaque processes.
🎟️ Tokenized Ownership & Revenue Share: Backers receive unique Investor Share NFTs representing their stake. These NFTs aren't just collectibles; they are keys to a share of future revenue from course sales and secondary market royalties, distributed automatically and transparently on-chain.
🗳️ Community Governance: Backers use their NFT stake to vote on project milestones. This ensures creators are accountable to the community that funded them, and funds are released as progress is made.
🛍️ Integrated NFT Marketplace: A dedicated secondary market to trade both Investor Share NFTs and Course Access NFTs. This provides liquidity for backers and allows access to be transferred.
✍️ Intuitive Course Editor: A clean, powerful, Notion-like editor allows creators to build rich, engaging course content with Markdown, images, and videos.
🔐 Token-Gated Access: Course content is exclusively and verifiably accessible to wallets holding the correct Course Access NFT.
